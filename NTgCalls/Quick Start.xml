        Welcome to this section, which is primarily intended for developers who are moderately experienced or
        seeking to perform a porting in their language using C bindings. If you are new to Python development,
        we strongly recommend using <docs-ref href="">Py-TgCalls</docs-ref>. However, if you fall into the aforementioned categories,
        you can find an example of usage with the various porting below.

        What we've just seen are simplified ports of NTgCalls. However, now let's delve deeper!
        In the upcoming pages, we'll explore NTgCalls in a step-by-step manner,
        covering how it functions, how to install it, and more.

        Are you feeling eager to continue?
        You can take a shortcut to the Call Methods
        section and return later to delve into more details.
