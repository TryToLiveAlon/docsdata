    <h1>Install Guide</h1>
    <text>
        Being a modern Python library, <b>PyTgCalls</b> requires Python 3.7+ to be installed in your system.
        We recommend using the latest versions of both Python 3 and pip.

    <h2>Install PyTgCalls</h2>
    <text>The easiest way to install and upgrade PyTgCalls to its latest stable version is by using pip:</text>
    <syntax-highlight language="bash">
        $ pip3 install -U py-tgcalls
    </syntax-highlight>
    <h2>Bleeding Edge</h2>
    <text>
        PyTgCalls is always evolving, although new releases on PyPI are published only when enough changes are added,
        but this doesn’t mean you can’t try new features right now!

        In case you’d like to try out the latest PyTgCalls features, the  <a href="https://github.com/pytgcalls/pytgcalls">GitHub repo</a> is always kept updated with new changes;
        you can install the development version straight from the <code>master</code> branch using this command (note “master.zip” in the link):
    </text>
    <syntax-highlight language="bash">
        $ pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/pytgcalls/pytgcalls
    </syntax-highlight>
    <h2>Verifying</h2>
    <text>To verify that PyTgCalls is correctly installed, open a Python shell and import it. If no error shows up you are good to go.</text>
    <syntax-highlight language="python">
        >>> import pytgcalls
        >>> pytgcalls.__version__
        '<config id="PYTGCALLS_VERSION"/>'
    </syntax-highlight>
