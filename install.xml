    <h1>Install Guide</h1>
    <text>
        Being a modern Python library, <b>PyTgCalls</b> requires Python 3.6+ to be installed in your system.
        We recommend using the latest versions of both Python 3 and pip.

    <h2>Install PyTgCalls</h2>
    <text>The easiest way to install and upgrade PyTgCalls to its latest stable version is by using pip:</text>
    <syntax-highlight language="bash">
        pip3 install -U py-tgcalls
    </syntax-highlight>
    <h2>Bleeding Edge</h2>
    <text>
        PyTgCalls is always evolving, although new releases on PyPI are published only when enough changes are added,
        but this doesn’t mean you can’t try new features right now!
        <br/><br/>
        In case you’d like to try out the latest PyTgCalls features, the  <a href="https://github.com/pytgcalls/pytgcalls">GitHub repo</a> is always kept updated with new changes;
        you can install the development version straight from the <code>master</code> branch using this command (note “master.zip” in the link):
    </text>
    <syntax-highlight language="bash">
        pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/pytgcalls/pytgcalls
    </syntax-highlight>
    <h2>Verifying</h2>
    <text>To verify that PyTgCalls is correctly installed, open a Python shell and import it. If no error shows up you are good to go.</text>
    <syntax-highlight language="python-shell">
        import pytgcalls
        pytgcalls.__version__
        <output>
            '<config id="PYTGCALLS_VERSION"/>'
        </output>
